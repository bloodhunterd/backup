# Backup

A simple backup application who creates backups of files and databases (incl. Docker container).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

PHP including the following modules are required to run the application.

* php-bz2ยน
* php-cli
* php-intl
* php-json

The server should also have a working MTA to send backup reports.

ยน only needed if the compressed version is used.

### Installing

Download the (compressed) backup application and place it somewhere on your server. For example at **/srv/**.

[![Phar BZ2](https://img.shields.io/github/size/bloodhunterd/backup/build/backup.phar.bz2?label=Backup%20(compressed)&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/bloodhunterd/backup/blob/master/build/backup.phar.bz2)

Download the example agent or manager configuration file and place it somewhere on your server. For example also at **/srv/**.

## Deployment

Adjust the configuration file for your needs and add an entry into the crontab to execute this script periodically.

```bash
0 4 * * * php /srv/backup.phar /srv/backup.json
```

In this example the backup would run every night at 4am.
